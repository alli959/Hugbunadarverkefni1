# Background
A lot of players and coaches in basketball have used statistics to understand their strengths and weaknesses. Many young players in Iceland, for example, don't have any ways to access their stats. Here is Iceland coaches or players mostly inspect and remember, or use a notebook to write down what's going on during the game.

This calls for a need for a simpler, faster way to track player statistics and overall game statistics.
This application gives anyone, including coaches and players, a way to visualize all information during the game easily, fast, simply and in real-time.
